# Store Front App

A 4-Phase build of the storefront application, written in React.

#### Phase 1 Requirements

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the storefront application, written
in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the
application with initial styling and basic behaviors. This initial build sets up
the file structure and state management so that we can progressively build this
application in a scalable manner

User Stories

- As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products
- As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category
- As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence
